## General information
The purpose of the project is to reduce the friction that client data team
faces when _onboarding_ and _maintaining_ data specifically for clients' financial
relationships. By reducing friction to client data team, financial advisers can
more efficiently offer their advice on clients' wealth, as financial data points
are rich and ready with respect to that client's data onboarding process.

According to domain, this project rely on a lot on financial data points that
are already processed and conceptualised by other upstream services and systems
within Y Tree. Systems-wise, there are currently two core dependencies:

- `ms-financialdata` - core client's financial data aggregator of several other systems.
- `ms-salesforce` - Salesforce (CRM tool) integration system that _unfortunately_
contains a few client's financial data.
